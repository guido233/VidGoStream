Everyone know what they do with all the stuff you dig up for them. That's not my job. No, but you never wonder. It's the CIA. I got to trust that they'll make the right call. Maybe it's better not to know. Bye bye. Charlie, I think you need to see this. What is this? Your wife has been killed. What you do is very important to what we do. Let us handle this. I want mission specific training, cash and a new identity. Have you lost your mind? I want to find and kill the people who murdered my wife. I don't think you could beat a 90 year old nun in an arm wrestling match. I want to face my wife's killers, look at them in the eyes. And balance the scales. Take it, take it. Point it at my chest. Do it. Now put your finger on the trigger. You can't do what I do, no matter how much I train you. You're just not a killer, Charlie. You're just a nerdy fella. Works on computers. What you doing? Just going to kill you. Do you ever account for the things I'm good at? You held a gun to my wife's head. This is a remote that controls the device that's been decompressing the glass beneath you. You have the wrong person. No, I have exactly the right person. We got a ping in Rome, he's in London, he just got on a bus in Prague. He practically invented half of our surveillance. Maybe y'all misjudged this individual. This ends here. You recognize her. If you jump really fast, you might survive the blast, right?
