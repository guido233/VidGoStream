Now, whether it's eaten fried, grilled or raw, Japanese flying squid is a staple of the country's cuisine. But low yields and high prices are putting that at risk. From the mailboxes. To its manhole covers. In Japan's northern Hokkaido prefecture is known for being a city of squid. Tourists flock there to try the delicious delicacy and can even catch their own squid at these fishing booths. But. Monday 9 was SCRIT. Holes get smaller every year. Today it was windy and the sea was rough so we didn't even get a delivery. Local restaurants and pubs are also struggling to put squid on people's plates. This restaurant says it has to pay more to buy squid and is passing that cost on to customers. It's had to triple its prices. 1 Diner said he was shocked by his bill. Flying squid is a casual dish. I didn't expect it to cost this much. It wasn't always like this. Flying squid has long been a pillar of Hakodati's fishing industry. Residents often ate that day's catch on the cheap. Back then, the Nets were full of squids. Numbers nationwide peaked in 1968 at around 660,000 tons. But that since plummeted. Preliminary figures suggest that last year the industry only caught about 20,000 tons. That's only 3% of the peak. One expert says there are several factors contributing to the decline. Japanese flying squid grow up in the East China Sea. Their numbers dropped as a result of sea temperatures, which were unusually low in 2015 and 2016. But fishing levels continued despite the shrinking squid population. Catches should be set to a level that can ensure there's enough adult squid to increase stocks. Japan's Fisheries Agency says that's easier said than done. It held a meeting Wednesday to discuss how to manage squid stocks. Officials said if each fishing operation reduced their catch of young squids by one ton, each one's average weight would more than triple over six months. But they acknowledged it's difficult to avoid catching smaller squids who still need to grow. Officials say they hope to have a comprehensive plan by the end of the year.
